# sulcata

## Description
A robot integration project by using ROS, Kobuki (Turtle Bot), and Kinect v2. ([for Korean](README_kr.md))

Users can:
- see the easiest way to build a ROS based robot.
- know the essential hardware/software for SLAM and navigation project.
- have scripts to launch the required ROS apps.

This can be useful for developers who have Kinect v2 instead of Kinect v1 or Xtion.  
(Sulcata is a species of tortoise. Since this project is a variation of Turtle Bot, I named it as sulcata project. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_spurred_tortoise" target="_blank">see also</a>))
